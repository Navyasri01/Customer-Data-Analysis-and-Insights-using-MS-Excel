# Customer-Data-Analysis-and-Insights-using-MS-Excel

The objective was to analyze real-world customer and transaction data provided by KPMG to derive meaningful business insights.

📁 Dataset

The analysis is based on four key datasets:

    Customer Address Dataset – Contains address and property valuation data.

    Customer Demographic Dataset – Includes personal and job-related information of customers.

    Transactions Dataset – Records customer purchases and transaction details.

    New Customer List Dataset – Contains information about prospective customers.


# Data Cleaning 

    Removed duplicate records from all datasets

    Standardized inconsistent formats (e.g., state names, address formatting)

    Corrected anomalies in categorical fields (e.g., gender, job titles, default status)

    Handled missing or null values appropriately

    Ensured date fields (e.g., transaction dates) were in a consistent format

    Verified numerical columns for proper data types (e.g., prices, valuations)

    Cleaned and unified entries across all datasets for reliable analysis
